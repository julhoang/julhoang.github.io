Tic Tac Toe with Intelligence

My code narrows the choice of boxes for the computer by eliminating boxes that “X” cannot use to win or form a path, and hence increases the probabilities of making a “smarter” move (which is to successfully block “X” pathway). 
Please refer to the attached illustration.

For instance, if the player places “X” at box 3, there is no need for the computer to block box 4 or box 8, because “X” is not likely to form a path by usings those boxes. 
However, if all target boxes (red “O”) are occupied, the computer will then play at one of the empty (blboxes.

My code primary intention is to block “X”s, and aim for a tie.
